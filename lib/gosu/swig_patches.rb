# SWIG workarounds
# These are offloaded into a separate file because rb_eval_string() is weird on Ruby 1.8.

# Exceptions in Window callbacks often get lost, this is especially annoying in draw/update.
# It is not clear whether this is a SWIG issue or if some stack frame is not exception
# compatible, but I just call protected_update etc. in the Ruby wrapper so I can add this
# custom debugging help:
class Gosu::Window
  %w(update draw needs_redraw? needs_cursor?
     lose_focus button_down button_up).each do |callback|
    define_method "protected_#{callback}" do |*args|
      begin
        # If there has been an exception, don't do anything as to not make matters worse.
        # Conveniently turn the return value into a boolean result (for needs_cursor? etc).
        defined?(@_exception) ? false : !!send(callback, *args)
      rescue => e
        # Exit the message loop naturally, then re-throw
        @_exception = e
        close
      end
    end
