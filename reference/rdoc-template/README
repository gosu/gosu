Allison modified for the Gosu project
=====================================

These are just my personal modifications for the Gosu library (libgosu.org).

If anyone considers them generally useful, I will try to wrap them up as an official contrib.

In any case, the copyright of even this modified version is solely the one of Cloudburst, LLC.

The original README follows.



Allison

A modern, pretty RDoc template.

== Installation

  sudo gem install allison

== Usage
  
To use the template, just run <tt>allison</tt> with your normal RDoc options. For example:

  $ allison --title 'My RDoc' --line-numbers --main README --promiscuous *
  
Note that some options like <tt>--one-file</tt> and <tt>--diagram</tt> might not work well.

= Extras

== Rake task

You can set up a Rake task if you want. First, find the path to your local machine's template by running <tt>allison --path</tt>. Then add something like the following to your <tt>Rakefile</tt>:
    
  require 'rake/rdoctask'
  
  Rake::RDocTask.new do |rdoc|
        files = ['README', 'LICENSE', 'CHANGELOG', 
                 'lib/**/*.rb', 'doc/**/*.rdoc', 'test/*.rb']
        rdoc.rdoc_files.add(files)
        rdoc.main = 'README'
        rdoc.title = 'My RDoc'
        rdoc.template = '/path/to/gems/allison-2.0/lib/allison'
        rdoc.rdoc_dir = 'doc'
        rdoc.options << '--line-numbers' << '--inline-source'
  end
  
Now you can run <tt>rake rdoc</tt> to invoke the task. Also, some versions of RDoc require <tt>.rb</tt> to be appended to the template path.

== Generating documentation for Rails

If you want to generate documentation for Ruby on Rails, there is a handy trick. Rails’ RDoc tasks obey the <tt>template</tt> environment variable. For instance, to document ActiveRecord, run:

  cd vendor/rails/activerecord/
  template=`allison --path` rake rerdoc
