= Ruby/Gosu Packaging on Microsoft Windows

To compile your Ruby game into an executable on Windows, you need to run it through the following program from the command line:

http://github.com/larsch/ocra/tree/master

In theory, it should be as simple as these two lines in a command prompt:

{{{
gem install ocra
ocra my_ruby_game.rb
}}}

If you are using sound, you have to ship `fmod.dll` too. Other gems like `ruby-opengl` might require their own DLLs too. You can put them in a `lib` subdirectory and then include them on the command line:

`ocra my_ruby_game.rb lib\*`

To let your game find the DLLs you have to change the PATH environment like this somewhere early in your game:

`ENV['PATH'] = File.join(GAMEROOT,"lib") + ";" + ENV['PATH']`

If you have any trouble, feel free to ask on the Gosu boards. Ocra is still a project in development and everybody can benefit from sharing your experience.
