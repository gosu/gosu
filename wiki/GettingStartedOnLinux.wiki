= Dependencies =

To install Gosu in any form, you will need the following packages (install via `sudo apt-get install <packagename>`):
  * g++
  * libgl1-mesa-dev
  * libpango1.0-dev
  * libboost-dev
  * libaudiere-dev
  * libsdl-ttf2.0-dev


*Copy-and-pastable command line* for Ubuntu, last tested on 10.10, should work across all versions:

{{{
# For C++
sudo apt-get install g++ libgl1-mesa-dev libpango1.0-dev libboost-dev libaudiere-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev
# To install the gem for Ruby 1.8
sudo apt-get install g++ libgl1-mesa-dev libpango1.0-dev libboost-dev libaudiere-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev ruby1.8-dev
# To install the gem for Ruby 1.9.1/1.9.2(?)
sudo apt-get install g++ libgl1-mesa-dev libpango1.0-dev libboost-dev libaudiere-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev ruby1.9.1-dev
}}}

*Please check* how to install all this software if you are on a different distribution.

= Ruby Gem =

If you are only interested in using Gosu with the Ruby programming language, you can install it as a Ruby gem via `sudo gem install gosu`. You need to install the packages from above.

Afterwards, `gem install gosu` should work.

= Compiling Gosu for C++ =

To compile Gosu, `cd` into the `linux` subdirectory and run:

{{{
./configure
make
}}}

There is a deprecated 'make install' command that will work for C++, but as most Linux distributions are using a package manager nowadays we recommend copying the resulting `linux/libgosu.a` file to your game's directory manually.
For using Ruby/Gosu, you can install Gosu globally by copying the resulting `linux/gosu.so` file to `/usr/lib/ruby/site_ruby/${your-ruby-version-here}/${your-arch-here}-linux/`, or also copy it next to your Ruby source files where it will be found.

= Using Gosu in C++ =

(The following assumes that you have installed Gosu system-wide via `sudo make install`. If not, you will have to add paths as necessary.)

You have to compile with ``gosu-config --libs``` and -Igosu ```gosu-config --cxxflags``, so a simple Makefile could look like this:

{{{
OBJS = main.o player.o
CXXFLAGS += `gosu-config --cxxflags`
LIBS = -lgosu `gosu-config --libs`

myGame: $(OBJS) libgosu.a
        g++ -o myGame $(OBJS) libgosu.a $(LIBS)
}}}
