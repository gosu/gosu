#summary How to set up Gosu on Mac OS X.

= Installing Boost (required for using Gosu with C++ only) =

[http://www.boost.org/ Boost] is a collection of libraries that is used throughout Gosu. Many parts of Boost have been marked for inclusion in the next standard of C++, so it's definitely worth a look a its docs.

*If you are using MacPorts*, you can, in theory, simply run `sudo port install boost`. In practice however, MacPorts' version of Boost is usually broken and/or outdated.

For most tasks, the headers of the boost library will be enough, so the easiest way to install them would be:
{{{
svn co http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk/boost boost
sudo mv boost /usr/local/include
}}}
  
(Replace "1_38" with boost's current version.)


= Starting a new Gosu game (C++) =

In Xcode, create a new 'Application/Cocoa Application' project.

Remove & trash the following files:

  * Resources/MainMenu.nib (or .xib, depending on the version of Xcode)
  * Other Sources/main.m

Then right-click "Other Frameworks" and add a reference to an existing framework, namely Gosu.framework. Make sure you didn't put Gosu.framework into a system directory like /System/Library/Frameworks because Xcode treats these directories with some magic.

In order to make the Boost headers accessible, select 'Project/Edit Active Project' from the top menu, search for 'Header Search Paths' in 'Build' and set it to `/usr/local/include`, or `/opt/local/include` if you used MacPorts to install Boost.

Your application bundle also needs to contain the Gosu.framework bundle. To instruct Xcode to automatically copy it into your application, choose Project/New Build Phase and select "Frameworks" as the Copy Files' target directory. Then locate this new build phase in the targets list and add Gosu.framework to it as well. (Note: You may have to drag & drop the framework into the build phase from the finder, instead of adding it via a right-click.)

*Note:* My version of Xcode defaults to using the 10.5 SDK. Gosu also works with 10.4 if you just select 10.4 everywhere, but you can do that once you've verified everything works.

You can then add new code files, for example the ones from the tutorial or this minimal application code:

{{{
#include <Gosu/Gosu.hpp>

class MyWindow : public Gosu::Window
{
public:
    MyWindow()
    : Gosu::Window(640, 480, false)
    {
        setCaption(L"Hello World!");
    }
};

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
    MyWindow win;
    win.show();
}

}}}

Note: Usually, you want to right-click your target, Get Info, select Build/All Configurations/Build Locations and *change the Per-configuration Build Products Path to '.'* or something similar, so the application will have the correct position relative to your game's resources.

= Starting a new Gosu game (Ruby) =

Getting started with Ruby is a lot easier (surprise):
  * If you installed Gosu using RubyGems (`sudo gem install gosu`), you just need to `require 'rubygems'` before you `require 'gosu'`.
  * Otherwise you need to run your code in a way that `require 'gosu'` will work, i.e. by either copying the contents of the `lib` folder into the same directory or installing it in one of Ruby's default library paths.

To test if everything works, you can use this Hello World script:

{{{
require 'rubygems' # Remove this line if you aren't using RubyGems
require 'gosu'

class MyWindow < Gosu::Window
  def initialize
    super(640, 480, false)
    self.caption = 'Hello World!'
  end
end

w = MyWindow.new
w.show
}}}

That's it — have fun!
