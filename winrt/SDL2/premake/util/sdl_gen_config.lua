sdl_gen_config.lua

	Given a series of set configuration values from the project definitions,
	this file contains a series of functions that generate valid preprocessor
	definitions to enable or disable various features of the SDL2 library. These
	definitions are pasted into a template SDL config header file, which is then
	saved in the local directory and referenced to in generated project files.

	This file depends on sdl_file.lua.

-- configuration line is wrapped around a preprocessor definition check, so they

-- either is allowed to be empty. That means the table stores key-value pairs.
